# Landsat Reflectance Data: On the Fly and at Your Fingertips

## Project GeoSync

### High-Level Summary

- Our project, GeoSync, aims to develop a web-based application that facilitates the comparison of ground-based environmental observations with Landsat satellite data.
- The application allows users to define specific target locations, receive notifications when a Landsat satellite is passing over that location, and access corresponding Landsat Surface Reflectance (SR) data for analysis.
- Core features include target location selection, enabling users to monitor areas of interest via an interactive interface, and direct access to Landsat SR data for comprehensive environmental monitoring.
- The impact and applications of GeoSync extend to various fields such as research and environmental monitoring, where it supports scientists studying ecosystems, land use changes, and climate impacts.
- It also aids agriculture by helping farmers monitor crop health through satellite imagery, assists urban planners in tracking urban growth and environmental changes, and enables authorities to manage and respond to natural disasters by comparing real-time data with satellite observations.

### Project Details

- Our project GeoSync basically provides a web application that shows a map in the home page.
- It provides the feature for searching a location .
- When the user selects a location, it pixelates that location in a 3x3 grid of 30x30m pixel.
- The page then shows a pop-up information about that location, its longitudes and latitudes , its scene ID, and when Landsat satellites are satellite is passing over the defined target location.
- It determines Landsat scene that contains the target pixel using the Worldwide Reference System-2 (WRS-2) and display the Landsat scene extent on a map.
- It provides a feature to download the metadata of the target scene in csv format.
